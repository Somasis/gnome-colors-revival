# gnome-colors-revival

An attempt to try and consolidate all gnome-colors icons and themes into one package. The state of the original icon pack is in extreme unkempt. Last updated by the original authors in 2009.

The original [GNOME Colors icon theme](http://code.google.com/p/gnome-colors/) was abandoned a long time ago and there appears to be no upstream activity, but a lot of people still use it as their theme regardless of it's age, since it is a very well made icon theme.

Since I'm one of these people, I'm going to try to take upon myself to make a central repository of these icons, so that there can be one place for the whole icon theme, and icons to supplement the originals.
